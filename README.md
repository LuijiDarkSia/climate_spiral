Background: Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist, unveiled an animated visualization in 2017 which captivated the world. This visualization showed the deviations of the global average temperature from 1850 to 2017. It was reshared millions of times over Twitter and Facebook and a version of it was even shown at the opening ceremony for the Rio Olympics.

This animation was created with the help of an article on Dataquest.io written by Srini Kadamati.
